MAC Org
=======

A tool to return the organization associated with a given MAC address.

This project intentionally contains only tests. The function bodies need to be implmented.

The project currently contains a number of failing doctests that can be run either by calling `make` or the doctest module directly.

A complete implementation should make all tests pass.
